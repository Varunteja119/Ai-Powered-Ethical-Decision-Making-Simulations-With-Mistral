# Ai-Powered-Ethical-Decision-Making-Simulations-With-Mistral

## 📌 Project Description

**AI-Powered Ethical Decision-Making Simulations with Mistral** is a web-based application that leverages **Mistral’s generative AI** and **Streamlit** to simulate and analyze real-world ethical dilemmas. This project is designed to make complex moral reasoning accessible to non-experts and can be used in educational, governance, and policy-making contexts.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **Python** – Backend logic and integration
* **Streamlit** – Interactive frontend
* **Mistral AI** – Ethical scenario generation via LLM
* **dotenv** (optional) – Secure API key handling
* **LangChain** (for future scope)

---

## 🧠 Application Workflow

1. **User Input**: Natural language ethical dilemma
2. **Model Invocation**: Mistral API is called using `mistralai`
3. **AI Processing**: Generates a detailed scenario evaluation
4. **Output Rendering**: Displayed in a visually styled Streamlit UI
5. **Feedback Loop**: User may iterate with different prompts

---

## 💬 Prompt Examples

* “Should autonomous cars prioritize passenger safety over pedestrian safety?”
* “Is it ethical to use AI surveillance in public spaces?”
* “Is it ethical for hospitals to prioritize treatment based on survival probability?”
